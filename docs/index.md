**MavenWorks** is a free open source dashboarding framework offering uniquely flexible and user-friendly ways to quickly build dashboards and analytical applications.

MavenWorks dashboards can be built and shared in a standalone app, running client-side without any server dependencies, or can optionally be shared with a MavenWorks Config Server.  Alternately MavenWorks dashboards can be built in JupyterLab, use a Jupyter kernel for server-side data retrieval and calculations, and be shared in JupyterLab or via a user-friendly Viewer
