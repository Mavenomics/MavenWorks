"""Python Cell Dashboard API.

This module provides an API for writing MavenWorks dashboards using Python. It
works in JupyterLab, using Jupyter-native machinery. Because it doesn't use the
same tooling as 'normal' dashboards, some editors (like the Visual Editor)
won't work with these types of dashboards.
