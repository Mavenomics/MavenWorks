# `@mavenomics/mql-worker`

RPC runner for an MQL engine running in a WebWorker.

The MQL engine can be a bit hairy to work with directly, but if you want to use
MQL in your app, this package is the best way to do it. It includes the MQL
worker pre-built, so you can just import the worker wrapper and hit the ground
running.
