# `@mavenomics/jupyterutils`

Common services and utilities for working with Dashboards in JupyterLab.

These are used by MavenWorks for JupyterLab, and the MavenWorks Dashboard Viewer.
However, some services (such as the CommManager or the PythonError) may be
useful on their own in other projects.
